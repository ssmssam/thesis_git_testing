  abstract={The electron energy distribution function (EEDF) at different radial positions is derived from Langmuir probe measurements in the CASTOR tokamak edge plasma using the first derivative method. It is shown that the EEDFs are not Maxwellian but can be approximated as bi-Maxwellians with one dominant, low temperature electron population and one minority composed of hotter electrons. In the limiter shadow the measured EEDFs are Maxwellian. The values of the plasma potential and electron densities at different radial positions are also evaluated. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that the first derivative method allows one to acquire additional plasma parameters using the electron part of the current–voltage characteristics in strongly magnetized tokamak edge plasmas.}

The radial profiles of the plasma potential, the electron energy distribution function and the electron densities are derived from the measured current-voltage probe characteristics by applying the firstderivative probe technique (FDPT). It is shown that close to the tokamak wall the electron energy distribution function is Maxwellian, while in the SOL, in the vicinity of the last closed flux surface and inside the confined plasma, the electron energy distribution function is bi-Maxwellian with a low-energy electron fraction dominating over a higher energy one. The radial profiles of the electron pressure and the parallel electron power flux density in COMPASS are also presented.}

  abstract={When an unmagnetized plasma comes in contact with a material surface, the difference in mobility between the electrons and the ions creates a non-neutral layer known as the Debye sheath (DS). However, in magnetic fusion devices, the open magnetic field lines intersect the structural elements of the device with near grazing incidence angles. The magnetic field tends to align the particle flow along its own field lines, thus counteracting the mechanism that leads to the formation of the DS. Recent work using a fluid model (Stangeby 2012 Nucl. Fusion 52 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0029-5515/52/8/083012] 083012 ) showed that the DS disappears when the incidence angle is smaller than a critical value (around ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0741-3335/58/2/025008/ppcfaa0bccieqn001.gif] {${{5}^{{}^\circ}}$} for ITER-like parameters). Here, we study this transition by means of numerical simulations of a kinetic model both in the collisionless and weakly collisional regimes. We show that the main features observed in the fluid model are preserved: for grazing incidence, the space charge density near the wall is reduced or suppressed, the ion flow velocity is subsonic, and the electric field and plasma density profiles are spread out over several ion Larmor radii instead of a few Debye lengths as in the unmagnetized case. As there is no singularity at the DS entrance in the kinetic model, this phenomenon depends smoothly on the magnetic field incidence angle and no particular critical angle arises. The simulation results and the predictions of the fluid model are in good agreement, although some discrepancies subsist, mainly due to the assumptions of isothermal closure and diagonality of the pressure tensor in the fluid model.}

  abstract={To achieve low deposited power flux density to solid surfaces in magnetic fusion devices, very small values of α are required, where α is the angle between B and the surface tangent. For an oblique magnetic field, there exists in front of the solid surface a Chodura sheath (CS) (also known as the ‘magnetic pre-sheath’) of thickness several ρ i , the ion Larmor radius. The standard assumption is that the CS is additional to the Debye sheath (DS) of thickness several λ D , the Debye length. Simple fluid modelling for collisionless CS conditions gives the drop in normalized electrostatic potential across the CS as e Δ φ CS / kT e = ln(sin  α ). For an electrically floating wall there is the separate constraint of ambipolar flow to the wall e Δ φ floating / kT e = 0.5 ln[(2 π m e / m i )(1 + T i / T e )], where Δ φ floating = Δ φ CS + Δ φ DS . For the case of a deuterium plasma and T i = T e , | e Δ φ floating / kT e | = 2.84. For α < 3.35°, | e Δ φ CS / kT e | exceeds 2.84 which evidently implies that the DS ceases to exist for such values of α and the entire potential drop would then occur across the CS. New analysis of the CS provides solutions for a number of quantities of practical importance, which improve on the solutions presently in use in models and edge impurity codes. Compared with the latter, the results of the present analysis indicate that (i) the E -field directed towards the solid surface is stronger and (ii) the plasma density drops more rapidly approaching the solid surface. The effect of (i) is to increase the probability of prompt local deposition of sputtered particles, while (ii) has the opposite effect.}

In some circumstances the portion of the probe I-V characteristic below floating potential may not be contaminated by magnetic field effects, and it can be possible to extract n e and T e from such data; unfortunately, it is not known with any certainty when this situation holds. By using a special probe with a small collecting element (pin) just in front of the principal collecting element (plate) it is possible to correct for the influence of the magnetic field, and to use simple single-probe theory to extract n e and T e . The uncertain influence of the non-ambipolar cross-field transport is entirely circumvented. Using such a probe it is possible to also use the part of the I-V characteristic above floating potential; thus, if the electron distribution is non-Maxwellian, that can be measured.}

Experimentally, studies of the phenomenon have been restricted to a comparison of measured data with analytic predictions of the I-V characteristic. Both theory and experiment show that the simple exponential law for electron collection assumed in the derivation of T c from the characteristic no longer holds for probe potentials above the floating potential. It is assumed, however, that the portion of the characteristic below floating potential can be used in deriving T c . By monitoring the potential of a small, electrically floating pin as a function of the voltage applied to a much larger plate located just behind it and interpreting the pin voltage as a direct measure of the plasma potential near the plate, the validity of this important assumption has been experimentally confirmed. Certain theoretical aspects of net electron collection have also been tested and have been found to be in reasonable agreement with experiment, indicating that more effort may be justified in attempting to use this region of the characteristic as a diagnostic tool.}

A very simple SOL model is developed to calculate the two-dimensional `fields' in the SOL,i.e. T ( s ∥ , s ⊥ ), n ( s ∥ , s ⊥ ), using measured boundary conditions from Langmuir probes built into divertor targets or limiters. The model is applied to a DIII-D discharge and comparisons are made between the model and measurements made by Thomson scattering and photodiodes.
