	abstract={Numerical simulations of interchange turbulence in the scrape-off layer are performed in a regime relevant for a specific L-mode Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST) discharge. Such a discharge was diagnosed with a reciprocating arm equipped with a Gundestrup probe. A detailed comparison of the average and statistical properties of the simulated and experimental ion saturation current is performed. Good agreement is found in the time-averaged radial profile, in the probability distribution functions and in qualitative features of the signals such as the shape, duration and separation of burst events. These results confirm the validity of the simple interchange model used and help us to identify where it can be improved. Finally, the simulated data are used to assess the importance of the temperature fluctuations on plasma potential and radial velocity measurements acquired with Langmuir probes. It is shown that the correlation between the actual plasma quantities and the signal of the synthetic diagnostics is poor, suggesting that accurate measurements of the temperature fluctuations are needed in order to obtain reliable estimates of the perpendicular fluxes.}

  abstract={Ball-pen probes (BPP) have been deployed in the SOL of numerous tokamak experiments and low-temperature magnetised plasmas to make direct measurements of the plasma potential and electron temperature. Despite strong empirical evidence for the success of the BPP it lacks a theoretical underpinning of its collection mechanism. In this paper we investigate the capability of the probe to measure the plasma potential by means of particle-in-cell simulations. The BPP is found to float at a potential offset from the plasma potential by a factor ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0741-3335/59/5/055007/ppcfaa60d0ieqn1.gif] {${T}_{{\rm{e}}}{\alpha }_{{\rm{BPP}}}$} . By simulating BPPs and Langmuir probes, excellent agreement has been found between the measured electron temperature and the specified source temperature. The transport mechanism for both ions and electrons has been determined. E × B drifts are observed to drive electrons and ions down the tunnel. This mechanism is sensitive to the diameter of the probe.}

	abstract={In this work, the fluctuations properties measured by Langmuir and ball-pen probes are compared, aiming at investigating the influence of temperature fluctuations on Langmuir probe measurements, including the cross-field turbulent particle flux. With this aim, a 5-pin probe was designed to estimate the radial particle transport due to fluctuations simultaneously using Langmuir and ball-pen probes. A considerable difference is observed in the amplitude of the floating potential fluctuations measured by the two types of probes, but not in statistical properties such as skewness. The turbulent particle flux was found to be roughly four times larger when measured with Langmuir probes. However, quantities such as the phase velocity of the fluctuations or the poloidal correlation lengths are not significantly different, as floating potential fluctuations measured by both types of probes are highly correlated and roughly in phase. Finally, it is suggested that ball-pen and emissive probes may underestimate the amplitude of the plasma potential fluctuations and therefore probe measurements must be carefully validated.}

In some circumstances the portion of the probe I-V characteristic below floating potential may not be contaminated by magnetic field effects, and it can be possible to extract n e and T e from such data; unfortunately, it is not known with any certainty when this situation holds. By using a special probe with a small collecting element (pin) just in front of the principal collecting element (plate) it is possible to correct for the influence of the magnetic field, and to use simple single-probe theory to extract n e and T e . The uncertain influence of the non-ambipolar cross-field transport is entirely circumvented. Using such a probe it is possible to also use the part of the I-V characteristic above floating potential; thus, if the electron distribution is non-Maxwellian, that can be measured.}

Langmuir probes are still one of the most commonly applied diagnostics in tokamaks but our understanding of how to interpret them in strong magnetic fields is still rather limited. Recent results from flush-mounted Langmuir probes in divertor plates are used to highlight the problem areas, in particular non-saturation of the ion current and low electron to ion saturation current ratios. The importance of measuring the parallel flow velocity in the plasma edge is highlighted and recent developments in theories for interpretation of Mach probes are discussed. Finally, the importance of diagnostics for ion temperature and impurity content is emphasized, and progress in the application of advanced electrical probes such as retarding field analysers and mass spectrometers to the tokamak boundary is reviewed in this context.}

((1949) in Characteristics of Electrical Discharges in Magnetic Fields (Edited by A. Guthrie and R. K. Wakerling). McGraw-Hill, New York). Experimentally, studies of the phenomenon have been restricted to a comparison of measured data with analytic predictions of the I-V characteristic. Both theory and experiment show that the simple exponential law for electron collection assumed in the derivation of T c from the characteristic no longer holds for probe potentials above the floating potential. It is assumed, however, that the portion of the characteristic below floating potential can be used in deriving T c . By monitoring the potential of a small, electrically floating pin as a function of the voltage applied to a much larger plate located just behind it and interpreting the pin voltage as a direct measure of the plasma potential near the plate, the validity of this important assumption has been experimentally confirmed. Certain theoretical aspects of net electron collection have also been tested and have been found to be in reasonable agreement with experiment, indicating that more effort may be justified in attempting to use this region of the characteristic as a diagnostic tool.}

  abstract={This paper summarizes the status of the COMPASS tokamak, its comprehensive diagnostic equipment and plasma scenarios as a baseline for the future studies. The former COMPASS-D tokamak was in operation at UKAEA Culham, UK in 1992–2002. Later, the device was transferred to the Institute of Plasma Physics of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic (IPP AS CR), where it was installed during 2006–2011. Since 2012 the device has been in a full operation with Type-I and Type-III ELMy H-modes as a base scenario. This enables together with the ITER-like plasma shape and flexible NBI heating system (two injectors enabling co- or balanced injection) to perform ITER relevant studies in different parameter range to the other tokamaks (ASDEX-Upgrade, DIII-D, JET) and to contribute to the ITER scallings. In addition to the description of the device, current status and the main diagnostic equipment, the paper focuses on the characterization of the Ohmic as well as NBI-assisted H-modes. Moreover, Edge Localized Modes (ELMs) are categorized based on their frequency dependence on power density flowing across separatrix. The filamentary structure of ELMs is studied and the parallel heat flux in individual filaments is measured by probes on the outer mid-plane and in the divertor. The measurements are supported by observation of ELM and inter-ELM filaments by an ultra-fast camera.}

	abstract={The L-mode interchange turbulence in the edge and scrape-off-layer (SOL) of the tight aspect ratio tokamak MAST is investigated numerically. The dynamics of the boundary plasma are studied using the 2D drift-fluid code ESEL, which has previously shown good agreement with large aspect ratio machines. In this context, a MAST-TCV comparison is presented in order to link the present analysis to well documented references. Next, scans of various edge parameters, such as density, temperature and current, are performed in the simulations with the aim of characterizing the profiles, fluctuation level and statistics of the edge/SOL density and temperature. In addition, we also discuss how the system changes when the length of the divertor leg is modified. This allows one to better understand the regime of operation of the Super-X divertor which will be implemented on MAST-Upgrade. The results obtained qualitatively agree with experimental observations. In particular, a universal behaviour of the fluctuation statistics is found for disparate edge conditions. Furthermore, the density and temperature decay lengths are inversely proportional to the plasma current and the edge temperature, while they are rather insensitive to the edge density (not to be confused with the line-averaged density).}

  abstract={Ion sensitive probes serve to measure the ion temperature in magnetized plasma. Such a probe typically consists of a collector submerged inside a hollow tube, which is oriented perpendicularly to the magnetic field. The principle of the probe is based on geometrical shielding of the ion collector from plasma electrons. According to the basic theory, when the collector is retracted in the tube, electrons with their small Larmor radii should not be able to reach it and the collector becomes sensitive to ions. However, experimental results show that the electron shielding is in general inefficient, it only works in the case when the potential of the collector is the same as the potential of the inside surface of the tube. This problem is investigated using a full 3D particle-in-cell Cartesian code with a fast multigrid Poisson solver. We simulate the plasma behaviour in the vicinity of a model of the ion sensitive probe. A positive potential structure is formed at the entrance of the tube due to the space charge of ions that gyrate inside. This structure produces E × B drifts, which push electrons into the shielded space. A stream of electrons hitting the collector is observed for various potentials of the collector. Simulations revealed that electrons can penetrate inside the geometrical shadow in all studied cases; however, they do not reach the collector when the potential of the collector is equal to the potential of the tube.}

abstract = {The paper describes an experimental investigation of the effects of grazing angles of incidence on the fluxes of power and particles to a surface inserted into the boundary of the DITE tokamak. Related thermographic data from the TFTR tokamak are also presented. A summary is given of the important issues relating to angle of incidence which are relevant to large tokamaks such as JET, NET and ITER and which require experimental confirmation. An array of Langmuir probes has been constructed to carry out experiments as a function of angle on DITE. Results from this tilting probe array (TPA) are described, which show how the ion saturation current, electron saturation current, floating potential and the fitted electron temperature vary with surface angle. It is shown that when the magnetic field is at grazing angles of incidence to the surface a conventional interpretation of the probe characteristics fails completely. Power flux distributions from infra-red thermography of the TFTR moveable limiter are presented, which show a substantially higher heat flux at the tangency point than is calculated conventionally.},

  abstract={To achieve low deposited power flux density to solid surfaces in magnetic fusion devices, very small values of α are required, where α is the angle between B and the surface tangent. For an oblique magnetic field, there exists in front of the solid surface a Chodura sheath (CS) (also known as the ‘magnetic pre-sheath’) of thickness several ρ i , the ion Larmor radius. The standard assumption is that the CS is additional to the Debye sheath (DS) of thickness several λ D , the Debye length. Simple fluid modelling for collisionless CS conditions gives the drop in normalized electrostatic potential across the CS as e Δ φ CS / kT e = ln(sin  α ). For an electrically floating wall there is the separate constraint of ambipolar flow to the wall e Δ φ floating / kT e = 0.5 ln[(2 π m e / m i )(1 + T i / T e )], where Δ φ floating = Δ φ CS + Δ φ DS . For the case of a deuterium plasma and T i = T e , | e Δ φ floating / kT e | = 2.84. For α < 3.35°, | e Δ φ CS / kT e | exceeds 2.84 which evidently implies that the DS ceases to exist for such values of α and the entire potential drop would then occur across the CS. New analysis of the CS provides solutions for a number of quantities of practical importance, which improve on the solutions presently in use in models and edge impurity codes. Compared with the latter, the results of the present analysis indicate that (i) the E -field directed towards the solid surface is stronger and (ii) the plasma density drops more rapidly approaching the solid surface. The effect of (i) is to increase the probability of prompt local deposition of sputtered particles, while (ii) has the opposite effect.}

Steady-state radial profiles demonstrate the credibility of the ball-pen probe. We demonstrate that floating potential fluctuations measured by a Langmuir probe are dominated by plasma electron temperature rather than potential. Spatial and temporal scales are found consistent with expectations based on interchange-driven turbulence. Conditionally averaged signals found for both potential and density are also consistent; however, those for temperature show an unexpected ~4 mm wide decrease by 10% at the very centre of a blob. In the wall shadow, temperature measured by the swept Langmuir probe yields values ~10 eV, whilst the ball-pen temperature gradient is more steep and credible, dropping down to ~1 eV.}

Experimentally, studies of the phenomenon have been restricted to a comparison of measured data with analytic predictions of the I-V characteristic. Both theory and experiment show that the simple exponential law for electron collection assumed in the derivation of T c from the characteristic no longer holds for probe potentials above the floating potential. It is assumed, however, that the portion of the characteristic below floating potential can be used in deriving T c . By monitoring the potential of a small, electrically floating pin as a function of the voltage applied to a much larger plate located just behind it and interpreting the pin voltage as a direct measure of the plasma potential near the plate, the validity of this important assumption has been experimentally confirmed. Certain theoretical aspects of net electron collection have also been tested and have been found to be in reasonable agreement with experiment, indicating that more effort may be justified in attempting to use this region of the characteristic as a diagnostic tool.}

  		abstract={Some of the basic aspects of the scrape-off layer, SOL, of magnetically confined plasmas are reviewed. SOLs defined by limiters and divertors are compared. The role of parallel heat convection versus conduction is considered and the relation to the desired condition of large ∇ ∥ T along the SOL is assessed. A very simple SOL model is developed to calculate the two-dimensional `fields' in the SOL,i.e. T ( s ∥ , s ⊥ ), n ( s ∥ , s ⊥ ), using measured boundary conditions from Langmuir probes built into divertor targets or limiters. The model is applied to a DIII-D discharge and comparisons are made between the model and measurements made by Thomson scattering and photodiodes. Values of D ⊥ SOL and χ ⊥ SOL are extracted from the experimental data using the simple model.}
