	abstract={One of the first studies of MAST Upgrade divertor configurations with scrape-off layer plasma simulation (SOLPS) 5.0 are presented. We focus on understanding the main prospects associated with the novel geometry of the Super-X divertor (SXD). This includes a discussion of the effect of magnetic flux expansion and volumetric power losses on the reduction of target power loads, the effect of divertor geometry on the divertor closure and the distribution of neutral species and radiation in the divertor, and the role of the connection length in broadening the target wetted area. A comparison in conditions typical for MAST inter-ELM H-mode plasmas confirms the improved performance of the Super-X topology resulting in significantly better divertor closure with respect to neutrals (the atomic flux from the target increased by a factor of 6, but the atomic flux from the divertor to the upper SOL reduced by a factor of 2), increased radiation volume and increased total power loss (a factor of 2) and a reduction of target power loads through both magnetic flux expansion and larger volumetric power loss in the divertor (a factor of 5–10 in attached plasmas). The reduction of the target power load by SXD further increases with collisionality (high density or detached regimes) thanks to the larger importance of volumetric power losses. It is found that a cold divertor plasma leads to stronger parallel temperature gradients in the SOL which drive more parallel heat flux, meaning that the effectiveness of perpendicular transport in spreading the power at the target can be reduced, and this needs to be taken into account in any optimization.}

  abstract={High fusion power experiments using DT mixtures in ELM-free H mode and optimized shear regimes in JET are reported. A fusion power of 16.1 MW has been produced in an ELM-free H mode at 4.2 MA/3.6 T. The transient value of the fusion amplification factor was 0.95±0.17, consistent with the high value of n DT (0)τ E dia T i (0) = 8.7 × 10 20 ±20% m -3 s keV, and was maintained for about half an energy confinement time until excessive edge pressure gradients resulted in discharge termination by MHD instabilities. The ratio of DD to DT fusion powers (from separate but otherwise similar discharges) showed the expected factor of 210, validating DD projections of DT performance for similar pressure profiles and good plasma mixture control, which was achieved by loading the vessel walls with the appropriate DT mix. Magnetic fluctuation spectra showed no evidence of Alfvénic instabilities driven by alpha particles, in agreement with theoretical model calculations. Alpha particle heating has been unambiguously observed, its effect being separated successfully from possible isotope effects on energy confinement by varying the tritium concentration in otherwise similar discharges. The scan showed that there was no, or at most a very weak, isotope effect on the energy confinement time. The highest electron temperature was clearly correlated with the maximum alpha particle heating power and the optimum DT mixture; the maximum increase was 1.3±0.23 keV with 1.3 MW of alpha particle heating power, consistent with classical expectations for alpha particle confinement and heating. In the optimized shear regime, clear internal transport barriers were established for the first time in DT, with a power similar to that required in DD. The ion thermal conductivity in the plasma core approached neoclassical levels. Real time power control maintained the plasma core close to limits set by pressure gradient driven MHD instabilities, allowing 8.2 MW of DT fusion power with n DT (0)τ E dia T i (0) ≈ 10 21 m -3 s keV, even though full optimization was not possible within the imposed neutron budget. In addition, quasi-steady-state discharges with simultaneous internal and edge transport barriers have been produced with high confinement and a fusion power of up to 7 MW; these double barrier discharges show a great potential for steady state operation. © 1999, Euratom}

abstract={Fusion materials research started in the early 1970s following the observation of the degradation of irradiated materials used in the first commercial fission reactors. The technological challenges of fusion energy are intimately linked with the availability of suitable materials capable of reliably withstanding the extremely severe operational conditions of fusion reactors. Although fission and fusion materials exhibit common features, fusion materials research is broader. The harder mono-energetic spectrum associated with the deuterium-tritium fusion neutrons (14.1[thinsp]MeV compared to <2[thinsp]MeV on average for fission neutrons) releases significant amounts of hydrogen and helium as transmutation products that might lead to a (at present undetermined) degradation of structural materials after a few years of operation. Overcoming the historical lack of a fusion-relevant neutron source for materials testing is an essential pending step in fusion roadmaps. Structural materials development, together with research on functional materials capable of sustaining unprecedented power densities during plasma operation in a fusion reactor, have been the subject of decades of worldwide research efforts underpinning the present maturity of the fusion materials research programme.},

  abstract={Fluid, particle-in-cell and hybrid models are the numerical simulation techniques commonly used for simulating low-temperature plasma discharges. Despite the complexity of plasma systems and the challenges in describing and modelling them, well-organized simulation methods can provide physical information often difficult to obtain from experiments. Simulation results can also be used to identify research guidelines, find optimum operating conditions or propose novel designs for performance improvements. In this paper, we present an overview of the principles, strengths and limitations of the three simulation models, including a brief history and the recent status of their development. The three modelling techniques are benchmarked by comparing simulation results in different plasma systems (plasma display panels, capacitively coupled plasmas and inductively coupled plasmas) with experimentally measured data. In addition, different aspects of the electron and ion kinetics in these systems are discussed based upon simulation results.}
